                                Howdy! My name is Kieran Lynch and I am currently based out of Chicago, Illinois. My professional experience includes bringing new products to market in the travel technology industry and driving software adoption. As of mid-2020, I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Development program at Northwestern Univsersity and learning how to build my own full stack applications. Some of my interests include enjoying a good cup of tea, giving belly rubs to my Bernedoodle puppy - Murphy, soccer, and traveling.
